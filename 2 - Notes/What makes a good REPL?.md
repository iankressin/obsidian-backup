# What makes a good REPL?

- A REPL allows allows to interact with each line of the software individually, which creates a faster feedback loop.

- Programming is a exploratory activity, and a REPL enable programmers to evaluate expressions and think in the next steps of the software being built.

- Unit tests answer the question "does it work?" but a REPL answer the questions: "how does it work" and "what does it look like?"
