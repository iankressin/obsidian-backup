# Andrew Huberman - Tools to improve focus & Concentration

![[arrow-model-hlp.excalidraw]]

- **Acetylcholine:** highlights specific neurons that should be more active in the environment. "Responsible for focus"
- **Epinephrine / Adrenaline:** increases overall energy and alertness. Doesn't increase focus alone.
- **Dopamine:** "Molecule of motivation" | "Engine that drives focus"

#### Modulation vs Mediation
- **Modulation:** Ability of cells, chemicals and circuits to adjust how things change/work more broadly 
	- Sleep **modulates** every process of brain and body

- **Mediation:**  How specific cells, chemicals and circuits in the brain and body

#### Tool: 40hz binaural beats
- Is shown by a large number of peer-reviewed studies that 40hz binaural beats can improve focus and concentration by increasing the levels of **acetylcholine and dopamine**
- **Recommendation:** Use 5 minutes before doing a bout of work
- **Recommendation:** Brainwave app

#### Tool: white, brown and pink noise
- Doesn't improve concentration, but improves the transition into concentrated states
- Amplifies the neurons activity in the prefrontal cortex. Directly related to the ability to direct and remain focused.
- **Recommendation:** use throughout bouts of work.

#### Warm up for cognitive work
- It's unrealistic the ability of immediate concentration, as it's unrealistic to lift heavy loads during a workout session before properly warming up.
- For focus and concentration, warming up means to increase of acetylcholine, epinephrine, and dopamine.

#### Tool: Ultradian cycles
- Circadian cycles are 24h cycle that our body operates, and within that day we operate in 90 minutes cycles called Ultradian cycles.
- Pushing for 2, 3, 4 hours focus periods is possible but not inline with the known biology.
- After a period of 45 - 90 minutes of focus it's important to go through a period of 10 - 30  minutes "defocus". 
- Rest between sets is vital for a workout as "defocus" is vital for cognitive work 
- **Recommendation:** tasks should be 90 minutes long at max to respect Ultradian cycles.
	- First 5 - 10 minutes should be accepted as transition to focus.
- **Recommendation:** do only 2 - 3 sets of deep focused work a day 
- **Think about:** what activities can be included into decompression phase?

#### Tools: diet
