## Goal
The goal is to raise funds for a year of development. The yearly estimated work is worth 30k.

## Grant options
### Ethereum Foundation
For general tooling there aren't a lot of options available for grants.
Ethereum foundation is the only option available for the kind of Grant EQL is looking for. Small grants provides grants up to 30k, which is exactly what we are looking for to work on the project for a whole year.
The process of applying to a grant involves a meeting with EF members to application validation and later on submitting the full application for review
### Optimism PGF

Optimism public goods funding, aims, to obviously, fund public goods related to blockchains. Trueblocks got one of their fundings from this project. Should dig deeper
### Hackathons
Hackathons is another funding option available. Participating on hackathon and compete for prizes in order to make fund the development of EQL is a good ideas.
