# Background

<aside> üèûÔ∏è Explain the information that your team needs to know, such as the industry, why this need arises.</aside>

2077 Bounties is 2077 Labs' response to [Superteam Earn](https://earn.superteam.fun/), a platform that has gained traction within the Solana ecosystem. Superteam Earn creates a dynamic environment where Solana dApps and protocols offer bounties for various tasks, including content creation, design, and development. This approach has not only facilitated direct connections between users and protocols but has also fostered deeper engagement within the community. As Emmanuel puts it, "people turn into lifelong evangelists if you help them make their first crypto."

# Problem

<aside> üí° State the problem. Describe the opportunities available, as well as the value that is created for the user. Tell the key points of the researches. Explain why this is a problem and why it's important for your business.</aside>
#### Lack of a bounty platform in the Ethereum Ecosystem
The Ethereum ecosystem, despite its vast potential and diverse applications, currently lacks a dedicated platform where projects can list atomic tasks‚Äîsmall, actionable tasks that can be completed independently‚Äîin exchange for payments. This gap presents a significant opportunity to create a solution that enables projects to efficiently crowd-source specific tasks to the community, thereby accelerating development and enhancing project outcomes. Such a platform would not only streamline project workflows but also empower contributors by offering them direct compensation for their work, making participation in the ecosystem more accessible and rewarding.

# Objectives / Goals

<aside> üéØ What will success look like in terms of solving this problem? Explain why are you building this and what do you hope to accomplish.</aside>
#### Creating a loyal community
By introducing a platform that directly connects users with projects through task-based contributions, we have the potential to cultivate a loyal and engaged user base. Users who contribute to projects in this manner are more likely to develop a vested interest in the success of those projects and, by extension, the broader Ethereum ecosystem. This loyalty is further reinforced by the direct financial incentives and the sense of accomplishment that comes from seeing their contributions make a tangible impact.
#### Central repository for collaboration on Ethereum
Creating a centralized repository of tasks for various projects within the Ethereum ecosystem can foster a stronger sense of community and collaboration. By aggregating tasks across projects, we provide a one-stop solution for community members looking to contribute, thereby simplifying the process of engagement.
